## General Info
This is the public repository for all files used in the practice sessions.\
Additional practice and help files may be uploaded here as well. For those who need help with Git, you can learn some more over at: [https://learngitbranching.js.org/](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) Though to be perfectly honest, most of Git is learned by using it, and via trial and error.

## Contact Me
TBA

**Please, feel free to contact me about anything.**

Functional Programming, and Clean itself, are far from the easiest things to pick up. This course is no breeze either. For some, it will click right away, and for some it will click later. Or even never.\
***This is okay.***\
You're all good at something different. We are here to help you with Functional Programming, so please let me help you. No question is a dumb question, and I want you to please ask any and all questions during class. If we have no time during class to address your questions, please bring them up during consultation or contact me to set up an appointment.

And please, **try to have fun!**
