## Latest Announcement

### The Midterm for FP will be conducted online. The time and date of the Midterm are still unchanged: April 17th from 4 pm to 7 pm. 
### That said, there are some important technical prerequisites for this online Midterm:

- **You must have a working @inf.elte.hu account on Microsoft Teams with access to the Clean lecture Team.**
- **You must have access to both Canvas and BEAD, and access to your correct group.**
- **You must have a working laptop or PC with a working Clean IDE or development environment of your choice.**
- **You must have a microphone that is on at all times.**
- **You must have a stable internet connection.**
- **You should have some sort of watch or timekeeping device, this can help you keep track of the time better.**

### Please check if you meet these requirements well before the Midterm. In the case that you can not meet one of these requirements, please email Viktoria and the Coordinator to officially declare the technical difficulties. There is no other way to be excused from the exam, anything else will be counted as an absence. In the case that you receive an official excuse from the Midterm, we will arrange a separate assessment depending on the number of students and the situation.

### Please email or message Hossam or me if you have any questions.

### The Midterm will focus on Higher-Order Functions, Lists, Recursion, and Guards. Sample Midterms are available on my website, and there are videos on the topics to be found on my Youtube as well.

This is the public repository for all files used in the practice sessions.\
You can easily access this Git repo via: [http://fp.yeet.codes](http://fp.yeet.codes)\
Additional practice and help files may be uploaded here as well. For those who need help with Git, you can learn some more over at: [https://learngitbranching.js.org/](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) Though to be perfectly honest, most of Git is learned by using it, and via trial and error.

## Contact Me
I am best reachable via [my email](sitt.evan@gmail.com). I check this pretty frequently.\
Alternatively, you may also choose to add me on [my Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Evan.Sitt) and message me via Messenger or message me via WhatsApp, although please keep in mind that I may not be able to reply instantly.

**Please, feel free to contact me about anything.**

Functional Programming, and Clean itself, are far from the easiest things to pick up. This course is no breeze either. For some, it will click right away, and for some it will click later. Or even never.\
***This is okay.***\
You're all good at something different. I'm here to help you with Functional Programming, so please let me help you. No question is a dumb question, and I want you to please ask any and all questions during class. If we have no time during class to address your questions, please bring them up during consultation or contact me to set up an appointment.

And please, **try to have fun!**
