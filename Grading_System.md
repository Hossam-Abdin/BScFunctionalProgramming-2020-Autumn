# Grading System Breakdown

Your mark will be determined by the combination of your marks across:
-  Homework
-  Progress Tasks
-  Theoretical Quizzes + Tests
-  Practical Coding Tests

## A more specific breakdown of marks:

* weekly mini-quizzes of 5 theoretical questions at the beginning of lab sessions.
At the end of semester out of 5 x 10 points min. 25 points must be achieved.
* weekly progress tasks consisting of one programming assignment at lab sessions
with their upload in BE-AD system before their deadline, evaluation.
At the end of semester out of 10 x 3 points min. 15 points must be achieved.
  #### Note : Both of the requirements above are not counted in the grade but it is essential to have at least 50% in each to have a grade.
* Homework (15% of the final grade)
* Mid-term (programming) (35% of the final grade) 
* End-term (programming) (35% of the final grade)
  #### Note : 15% of the final grade comes from two theoretical exam quizzes (from both Mid-term and End-term)

## Grade Cutoffs:
* Grade 2 : 50-60%
* Grade 3 : 61-70%
* Grade 4 : 71-85%
* Grade 5 : 86-100%

Students **MUST** at least pass every category *(receive 50% or greater)* to receive a final grade. Failing any single category will result in a final grade of 1 (Failing).
