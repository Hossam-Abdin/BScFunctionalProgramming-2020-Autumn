	8. In a boxing match, there are two fighters and we need to run a simulations to determine who will win 
	(return the winner's name and the number of round he won at in a tuple).
	Each fighter has: health points, attacking points and defense points. 
	The match is 10 rounds, 
	in each round one of the two fighters can punch the other fighter and the round ends, and in the next round the other fighter
	will be the one who throw the punch and so on.
	The punch should subtract x points from the health points of the fighter (who gets hit of course), x = attacking points - defending points.
	In case fighter's health points reaches 0, he/she loses.
	NOTE: The first fighter (first argument in the function) always starts.
	NOTE: If 10 rounds passed without any winner reutrns ("No winner", 22)
	NOTE: If the defending points is bigger than the attacking points of the other fighter the health points stay the same
	Example:
	Fighter A has health points: 100, attacking points: 50, defending points: 30.
	Fighter B has health points: 40, attacking points: 20, defending points: 10.
	when A hits B, B's health points will be equal to 40 - (50 - 10) = 0.
